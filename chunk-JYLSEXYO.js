Aiming to exploit the entire musical spectrum, they orbit around a solid sound body, which has as its main source a monophonic synthesizer that he developed in Max/MSP and gives a precise timbre direction with radical aesthetic constraints. Each track of the EP stands out from the others both because of the concept that is at its heart, and for the architectural-compositional setting. Each piece, in fact, has its own distinct form, deriving from the polymorphism of processes, from the intersection of these and from the search for an ever new use of the starting sound material. However, the feature that unites the three Sfilate Spaziali is the dichotomous alternation of rhythmically tight moments in contrast to more airy and rarefied parts. In the former, the digital material is compressed into a solid rhythmic pattern, almost claustrophobic, which evokes the rigid molecular structures of plastic materials and which leaves no space for action except for the repetition of the various components. In the freer and more irregular sections, however, the musical fabric dissolves and opens up to broader scenarios. This continuous succession of dense rhythms and expansions of sound gives life to the Sfilate Spaziali, finally integrated by the single titles of the tracks, which fully contribute to their existence.
