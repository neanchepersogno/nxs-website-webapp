                  Renato Grieco presents: Un ordine delle cose
                </button>

              <strong>Un ordine delle cose</strong> is a musical reading of excerpts from <i>L’ordine delle cose</i>, a collection of philosophical essays that reveal to humankind the world of living beings in its absence, inviting us to discover, precisely, the order of things.
                The volume, published in 1958, is the work of Jacques Brosse, a psychoanalyst, and an expert in botany and religions.
                Renato Grieco composed the musical interludes in February 2024, while reading and rereading this gem. Science and truth blend with imagination and the ingenuousness of a gaze attentive to microscopic details.

                <p>
              <strong>Renato Grieco</strong> is a composer and musician from Naples, south Italy. Grieco has been performing internationally since 2012, both as a solo artist (under the moniker <strong><i>k</i>NN</strong>) and in numerous collaborations as musician, performer and sound dramaturge. Grieco's music originates in musique concrète craftsmanship, culminating in orchestrations where period instruments, imaginary lutherie, and sculptural rooms coexist. Speculative folklore, vocal architecture, and hauntology are the kernel of his practice.

                <div style="height: 0.5em"></div>
                A whimsical creative experiment of free composition and monotype printing inspired by <i>ALDA</i>, the illustrated book by Alessia Carli dedicated to the poet Alda Merini.
                A handful of rebellious and tempestuous words escape the pages of the book to be deconstructed and reassembled in the hands and minds of children, through a collective game of transformations where conscious choice and chance alternate. Words blur, change shape and sound, and give life to new, unexpected, eccentric, and dreamlike poetic images.

                 <strong>Isa Nebl</strong> lives and works in Cles (Trento, IT), where she alternates her activity as a painter and illustrator with that of an atelierista, leading creative workshops at the <i>Batibōi Gallery</i>. She holds a diploma in Applied Arts and specialised at the International School of Printmaking and Lithography Il Bisonte in Florence.
She loves to invent dreamlike and enigmatic characters, which she brings to life through screen printing and a mixed technique combining acrylic painting and collage.

                <strong>Dead Crayons</strong> is a power trio from Florence, formed in 2020 with the aim of giving shape to the strong musical affinity shared by its members. Their sound, which first emerged through improvisation, intertwines noise rock with post-punk and sludge influences. In 2023, they recorded <i>Touches</i>, a self-produced EP released on 33’’ vinyl in the autumn.

<strong>Valerio Maiolo</strong>, sound performer and audio engineer based in Bologna, exploits nowaday computational techniques for digital real-time sound synthesis, in an inseparable process of mimesis with the human voice in the performative space.</p>

<p>As a performer, his focus lies in designing intelligent and adaptive hardware and software interfaces—an intersection where engineering, music and craftsmanship converge.</p>

<p>Theoretical work is at the heart of his musical research and is placed between the study of partially ordered sets of pitches, number theory and group theory.</p>

<p>The harmonic experience is embodied in the daily practice of overtone singing as well as physical exercises involving the sensation and internalization of integer numbers and ratios between them.</p>

<p><i>curve25519</i> is a work that focuses on the intrinsic quality of secrecy that arises in the miracle of the sublimation of the verbal into a non-public, intimate, private communication.
The name of this work is that of a particular elliptic curve on the finite field defined by the pseudo-Mersenne prime number 2^255 - 19, hence the “25519” in the name. It implements a cryptography used to establish a shared secret through an insecure channel.
The performance is based on 'c2oC' (computer2organs Communication system), in which the computer mediates communication between two pre-MIDI electric organs electronically hacked to interact with each other. The harmonic ornamental motifs of the organs located in the performative space intertwine with digitally synthesized sounds and the natural harmonics of the voice.
This system was first presented to the public in the 2019 electroacoustic work “the neat sensation of our separation,” hosted in a quadraphonic version by the Chiostro di San Michele in Fano, the Cimitero Monumentale della Certosa in Bologna, and the Conservatorio G.B. Martini.</p>

               <p><strong>Leonardo Rubboli</strong> (freak folk, electronics, wind and string instruments) is a musician and sound engineer whose research spans philosophy, sound, and technology, weaving together interdisciplinary projects ranging from music albums to installations, workshops, and performances. </p>

<p>He actively collaborates as a producer and live performer within the Heith project, particularly on the albums <i>X,Wheel</i> and <i>Escape Lounge</i>, released by the Berlin-based label PAN, as well as in performances and concerts at international festivals such as Rewire, Unsound, CTM, Berlin Atonal, and Terraforma.</p>

<p>In his live shows, folklore and mythology merge in a short circuit where past, present, and future feed into one another, shaping a metaphysical and esoteric order that opens the possibility of new realities. This feedback loop between what appears real and what remains inexplicable becomes the ground for a sonic and performative investigation that may take the form of sound or image, installation or ritual, song or prayer, fable or falsehood.</p>

                <p>Previously involved with the lauded Haunter Records - a label for which she released the single Ruba Meta on the label’s compilation <i>forever</i>. Additionally, Tadleeh released a debut EP on Why Be’s Yegorka label titled <i>Ego Will Collapse</i>, followed by the <i>1 Year Remix Pack</i> digital release, which included contributions from CRYSTALLMESS and Slikback (Yegorka, 2020). This was followed up in 2023 with a new EP <i>Dribbling</i>, released on NKISI’s label INITIATION. </p> 
                <p>From 2019-2021, Tadleeh helmed a Noods Radio Residency, and was the creative mind behind the now retired, forward-thinking events series Sine Confine in Milan.</p>
                <p>Tadleeh has performed at numerous venues, clubs, festivals and institutions across Europe including Cafe OTO (London UK), Argo16 (Venice IT), MUTEK (Barcelona ES), Sonic Acts (Amsterdam NL), Robot Festival (Bologna IT), ICA Milano (Milan IT), HAU - Dgtlfmnsm (Berlin DE) and MAO (Turin IT).

                <p>Italian composer and experimental electronic artist <strong>Corgiat</strong>  explores the thresholds between classical composition and contemporary sound design. His work deconstructs traditional musical forms, reassembling them through processes of synthesis, recombination, and transformation.
Working within an airy–orchestral framework, he blends acoustic instrumentation — strings, organ, voices, winds — with electronic textures, creating soundscapes that move between stillness and instability, resonance and dissolution.
Corgiat’s practice is rooted in the search for form within impermanence: a music of transitions, where harmonic architecture and noise coexist in a delicate equilibrium.

            <strong>de' Lamperi</strong> is Francesco Toninelli, sound artist
            from Florence, Italy. His production focuses on the discovery and
            reinvention of the past and its representations, taking
            historiographical, literary and vernacular sources as starting
            points and materializing them in diverse forms: cinema for the ears,
            sonic theatre, fictional philology. For the occasion he will present
            a work of multidisciplinary storytelling based on mesopotamic
            literary motifs and bronze age-inspired self-built acoustic
            instruments.

          <p></p>
          <strong>Martenot</strong> is the solo moniker of Simone Gottardi, an
          experimental musician and sound artist based in Turin. His
          compositions, exclusively computer-generated, are founded on the use
          of a minimalist vocabulary and a digital synthesis apparatus shaped by
          strict constraints. This approach establishes a precise aesthetic
          direction, characterized by the dichotomous alternation of
          claustrophobic patterns, which evoke the rigid molecular structures of
          plastic materials, in contrast to freer and more irregular sections in
          which the musical fabric dissolves and opens up to airy and rarefied
          scenarios.
          <p>
            In 2022, he launched his curatorial project
            <i>Neanche Per Sogno</i>, releasing his debut EP
            <i>Sfilate Spaziali</i>, followed by a series of live performances
            and the release of <i>Faceshopping RMX</i> in July 2023. After
            participating in events like <i>Transart</i> with a multichannel
            sound installation, he completed his studies at the Conservatorio G.
            Verdi in Turin in 2024.

                Through the workshop led by <strong>Angelica Stimpfl</strong>,
                participants explore and share their own sound experiences,
                transforming them into matrices suitable for printing. The
                technique used is “last-minute” screen printing, designed to
                teach a simple and quick way to reproduce images. All
                participants receive tote bags on which they can create their
                own personalized prints for the Neanche Per Sogno Vol.2
                exhibition. They are also encouraged to bring their own items
                (hoodies, t-shirts) to print on and will contribute to a
                large-scale collective artwork to be displayed during subsequent
                exhibition activities.

                  <strong>Mercury Hall</strong> is a musician (magnetic tapes,
                  field recordings, and electronics) and music producer, who
                  emerged in the 2000s from the prolific independent scene of
                  Vittorio Veneto, culminating with the Codalunga experience. By
                  filtering the anarchic extremity of noise through the tight
                  grids of disciplined, almost academic electroacoustics, he has
                  created an extraordinary aesthetic and sonic universe, notable
                  for its coherence and personality. Castro operates like the
                  architect of a virtual sound space—unstable yet direct,
                  formless, and constantly evocative. Previously active under
                  the names <i>Kam Hassah</i> and <i>Endless Sea</i>, his recent
                  solo project Mercury Hall marks a new chapter in one of
                  Italy’s most stimulating musical journeys. <i>Lettera 22</i>,
                  <i>Primorje</i>, and <i>Casa Di Caccia</i> are among his group
                  experiences. He is also the founder of the labels
                  <i>Second Sleep</i>, active since 2007, and
                  <i>Musica Moderna</i>.

                  From the Beach Boys to Ariel Pink, from Daniel Johnston to the
                  Microphones/Mount Eerie, the so-called lo-fi—short for “low
                  fidelity”—has now become a major chapter in the history of
                  indie music. But what fascinates us about these grainy,
                  home-recorded sounds, which drown exquisite pop melodies in a
                  tangle of hiss and unintended reverberations? And how can
                  lo-fi help us understand our relationship with the instruments
                  of power through technology, so that we might hack them to
                  shape our most intimate fantasies? Part music essay, part
                  private diary, part refined experiment in applied philosophy,
                  <i>Bassa Fedeltà</i> drags us into the dreamlike realms of
                  “bedroom music” par excellence, making Brian Wilson converse
                  with Félix Guattari, Perfume Genius with Mark Fisher, black
                  metal with Paolo Virno, transforming lo-fi musicians into
                  cyberpunk explorers of DIY recording and revealing how these
                  sounds—upending the hi-tech dogma—tell us about ourselves, our
                  lives under capitalism, and the strange ways we grapple with
                  pain, madness, and beauty.

                  The remarkable world of electronic music has been constantly
                  evolving since its inception in the early 20th century. From
                  the unlimited possibilities of digital synthesisers, to the
                  recent analog recording revival; from the impossibly perfect
                  pitch of Auto-Tune, to the democratisation of music making for
                  a generation of 'bedroom’ producers, each of these
                  extraordinary developments is directly connected to the work
                  and artistry of the women featured in “Sisters with
                  Transistors”.

                  <strong>Heith</strong>’s music traverses multiple sonic
                  landscapes, settling in a no-man’s-land of electronic music
                  where organic and digital elements constantly intersect. Often
                  evoking confusion and disorientation, his music lays the
                  groundwork for a mediated conflict between different
                  practices, evident in his debut album X, wheel (2022, PAN),
                  where synthesizers, percussion, guitars, and electronics
                  occupy and compete for the same space. If X, wheel marked the
                  beginning of a tortuous exploration of consciousness, the
                  following EP, The Liars Tell… (2024, PAN), feels more like a
                  truce—a moment of meditation and pause from the strain of
                  dimensional leaps. At the center of this work is a hypnotic
                  exploration of synthesizers and voice, treated as a fragile,
                  spectral presence and rendered material through intense
                  digital transformations. After founding the label Haunter
                  Records in 2013, Heith became part of the curatorial team at
                  the legendary Milanese venue Macao. He has released a series
                  of EPs (Laguna 2018, Mud 2019, Lo Zoo di Venere 2020) and
                  collaborated with numerous artists, including Puce Mary,
                  Visio, Kareem Lotfy, and Jesse Osborne-Lanthier.

                  <strong>VIBRISSE</strong> is a two-headed project based in
                  Turin that works through frenetic and unpredictable selections
                  to break down any kind of separation between musical genres,
                  people, and emotions. The focus is on high-BPM hardcore, while
                  simultaneously incorporating influences from the contemporary
                  digital club scene. On the dance floor, the duo creates
                  euphoric experiences where tracks from across the entire
                  hardcore spectrum (uptempo, mainstyle, frenchcore, j-core,
                  gabber, makina) collide with unexpected hits drawn from other
                  equally energetic styles (slowstyle, EDM, 160 club, donk).
                  Their tracks have been released on labels such as Safe Cloud
                  Records (FR), Country Music (SE), Burenhinder (BE), Club Late
                  Music (FR), and Nightcore4TotalSluts (UK), while their
                  uncompromising mixes have appeared on Toxic Sickness (UK),
                  Childsplay (UK), Wixapolonia (PL), Gabber Industries Berlin
                  (DE), Ashida Park (AU), Soul Feeder (ITA/DE), Unizone (CZ),

                  between body and technology in relation to the space that
                  hosts them, using pressure sensors and motion-tracking

                  Deep Listening: A Composer's Sound Practice. With Diana Lola Posani</button>

                  <i>Deep Listening</i> is a practice created by Pauline
                  Oliveros, an American queer composer, improviser, and
                  performer, which explores the difference between the
                  involuntary nature of hearing and the voluntary, selective
                  nature of listening. In her book
                  <i>Deep Listening: A Composer's Sound Practice</i>, she
                  defines deep listening as learning to expand one’s perception
                  of sounds to include the entire space-time continuum of sound,
                  embracing as much of its vastness and complexity as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Practically, deep listening involves exercises in bodily
                  proprioception and guided listening to everyday sounds. In
                  this workshop, listening is explored as a poetic tool to
                  expand the boundaries of reality. Starting from Pauline
                  Oliveros’ deep listening practice, participants are guided to
                  rediscover the imaginative potential of listening, allowing
                  inner sounds to reveal new, unexplored landscapes.

                  writes for A Row of Trees, the journal of the Sonic Art
                  Research Unit (SARU) at Oxford Brookes University, and debuted
                  in 2022 on Fango Radio with the podcast Kaikokaipuu. Her
                  current research focuses on the shared space between sound and
                  poetic imagination through interdisciplinary works and sound
                  poetry. In March 2023, she published her Italian translation

                  transforming recordings into subtly unreal spaces by altering

                  Lefka’s exploratory musical practice is complemented by the
                  work of graphic designer and multidisciplinary artist
                  <strong>Fac</strong>, whose creations oscillate between the
                  real and the fictional, the natural and the artificial, the
                  recognizable and the unsettling. For Neanche Per Sogno, the
                  duo joins forces to present their new live A/V performance.

                  <strong>Lemmo</strong> is a composer and sound researcher
                  active in the field of electronic and experimental music.
                  Their work investigates the possibilities of algorithmic
                  composition in dialogue with acoustic space and as a listening
                  practice, both within sound research and in multidisciplinary
                  contexts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A central focus of their practice is the electronic medium as
                  a tool for observation and exploration: on one hand, through
                  algorithmic programming for sound synthesis and the processing
                  of complex data structures; on the other, through the study of
                  recorded sound and field recordings.
                </p>

                <p></p>
                <p>
                  They also work as a sound designer for performing and visual
                  arts, collaborating with artists such as Chiara Bersani,
                  Teatro Valdoca, and Margherita Morgantin, and teach electronic
                  music. Their releases include the LP <i>COSMIC SILENCE</i> 5
                  and fluorescence 4 with Margherita Morgantin (XONG collection,
                  Xing).

              <p>
                Founded in Trento at the end of 2021,
                <strong>Trigger Collective</strong> is driven by a passion for
                sonic experimentation through unconventional means and
                approaches. Its aim is to create opportunities to share and
                intertwine different expressive forces, going beyond the
                individual dimension of its members.
              </p>
              <p>
                In its first year, the collective actively involved 15 artists
                and continuously draws inspiration from experimentation with
                live coding, analog synthesizers, feedback techniques, and
                hacked toys.

              <p>On this occasion, the featured projects are:</p>
              <div style="height: 0.5em"></div>
              <p>
                <strong>IanO</strong> is an 8bit-core producer presenting a
                custom set inspired by the fantasy atmospheres of
                <i>Dungeons & Dragons</i> and <i>Zelda</i>.
              </p>
              <div style="height: 0.5em"></div>
              <p>
                <strong>Return_Nihil</strong> is the project in which Ardan Dal
                Rì arranges structures within source code, handles real-time
                errors, formalizes, elaborates, and eliminates.
              </p>
              <div style="height: 0.5em"></div>
              <p>
                <strong>Buzzkeeper</strong> is a love letter to feedback,
                crafted by Ardo and Jack Slow.
              </p>
              <p>
                No-input mixers serve as the sole sound source, while the
                feedback they generate is manipulated but never fully tamed due
                to its unpredictable nature. Buzzkeeper reveres the spontaneous
                life of feedback and inhabits the tension between chaos and
                direction.

                <strong>.itch.itch.itch</strong> is the musical project of Yarin
                Sassudelli, guiding listeners through cosmic atmospheres and
                spatial imaginaries created solely with a modular synthesizer.

              <strong>Maurizio Berta</strong> is an Italian composer and
              performer interested in using algorithmic processes to organize
              sound materials.
            </p>
            <p>
              For <i>Neanche Per Sogno Vol.0</i>, he presents a set in which the
              order of the listening material—ranging from ambient to dub and
              breakbeat—is determined by an AI system, bringing to the stage a
              method that has become common in streaming-based listening.
            </p>
            <p>
              The AI shapes the musical journey according to the acoustic
              similarity parameters deemed most relevant among the selected
              sound materials.

              <strong>Martenot</strong> is the solo project of Simone Gottardi,
              an experimental musician and sound artist based in Turin.
            </p>

            <p>
              His computer-generated compositions use a minimalist vocabulary
              and digital synthesis shaped by strict constraints, alternating
              between claustrophobic, structured patterns and freer, airy
              passages.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2022, he launched his curatorial project
              <i>Neanche Per Sogno</i> and released his debut EP
              <i>Sfilate Spaziali</i>, a seminal three-track record.

            <p>
              <i>Antropo-Amorfo</i> project that oscillates between abstraction
              and real-world forms. <strong>Corgiat</strong>, a composer and
              researcher from Turin, assembles, transforms, and projects
              concrete, synthetic, and instrumental sounds. The power ambient
              textures interact in real time with visual artist
              <strong>Akasha</strong>, the stage name of Riccardo Franco-Loiri,
              creating a synchronized flow of acoustic and visual data, where
              digital geometric shapes intertwine with tangible materials.
