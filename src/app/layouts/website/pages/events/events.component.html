          <div style="height: 0.5em"></div>
          <p>On Saturday 13 and Sunday 14 September, <strong>The Listeners Ripple</strong> brings two days of live concerts and performances at PAV – Parco Arte Vivente in Turin, celebrating the emerging contemporary music scene.</p>

<p>The initiative is part of a broader training and mentorship project for young curators, through which <strong>The Listeners</strong>, an informal network dedicated to transdisciplinary sound-based practices, reaffirms its commitment to supporting and guiding emerging professionals in the field of live performance.</p>

<div style="height: 0.5em"></div>

<p>For the 2025 edition of <strong>Ripple</strong>, the selected curatorial projects and collectives are <strong>Neanche Per Sogno</strong> and <strong>QUOIS</strong>.</p>

<div style="height: 0.5em"></div>

<p>The evening of 13 September, curated by <strong>Neanche Per Sogno</strong>, features performances by <i>Aleksandra Słyż</i>, <i>Ciro Vitiello</i>, and <i>Nocturnerror</i>, exploring sound composition and manipulation across electroacoustic approaches, synthesis techniques, timbral layering, and improvisation.</p>

<p><strong>QUOIS</strong> curates the evening of 14 September, offering a musical journey that challenges conventions: from <i>Marina Boselli</i>’s euphonium concert, highlighting its surprising versatility, to <i>Timothée Quost</i>’s hyper-amplified trumpet experiments, and the fusion of Brazilian folk tradition and jazz sensibilities by the duo <i>BRIGADERA</i> (<i>Beatrice Sberna</i> and <i>Gabriel de Oliveira</i>), joined for the occasion by <i>Sara Guidolin</i>.</p>

            <strong>de' Lamperi</strong> is Francesco Toninelli, sound artist
            from Florence, Italy. His production focuses on the discovery and
            reinvention of the past and its representations, taking
            historiographical, literary and vernacular sources as starting
            points and materializing them in diverse forms: cinema for the ears,
            sonic theatre, fictional philology. For the occasion he will present
            a work of multidisciplinary storytelling based on mesopotamic
            literary motifs and bronze age-inspired self-built acoustic
            instruments.

          <p></p>
          <strong>Martenot</strong> is the solo moniker of Simone Gottardi, an
          experimental musician and sound artist based in Turin. His
          compositions, exclusively computer-generated, are founded on the use
          of a minimalist vocabulary and a digital synthesis apparatus shaped by
          strict constraints. This approach establishes a precise aesthetic
          direction, characterized by the dichotomous alternation of
          claustrophobic patterns, which evoke the rigid molecular structures of
          plastic materials, in contrast to freer and more irregular sections in
          which the musical fabric dissolves and opens up to airy and rarefied
          scenarios.
          <p>
            In 2022, he launched his curatorial project
            <i>Neanche Per Sogno</i>, releasing his debut EP
            <i>Sfilate Spaziali</i>, followed by a series of live performances
            and the release of <i>Faceshopping RMX</i> in July 2023. After
            participating in events like <i>Transart</i> with a multichannel
            sound installation, he completed his studies at the Conservatorio G.
            Verdi in Turin in 2024.

                Through the workshop led by <strong>Angelica Stimpfl</strong>,
                participants explore and share their own sound experiences,
                transforming them into matrices suitable for printing. The
                technique used is “last-minute” screen printing, designed to
                teach a simple and quick way to reproduce images. All
                participants receive tote bags on which they can create their
                own personalized prints for the Neanche Per Sogno Vol.2
                exhibition. They are also encouraged to bring their own items
                (hoodies, t-shirts) to print on and will contribute to a
                large-scale collective artwork to be displayed during subsequent
                exhibition activities.

                  <strong>Mercury Hall</strong> is a musician (magnetic tapes,
                  field recordings, and electronics) and music producer, who
                  emerged in the 2000s from the prolific independent scene of
                  Vittorio Veneto, culminating with the Codalunga experience. By
                  filtering the anarchic extremity of noise through the tight
                  grids of disciplined, almost academic electroacoustics, he has
                  created an extraordinary aesthetic and sonic universe, notable
                  for its coherence and personality. Castro operates like the
                  architect of a virtual sound space—unstable yet direct,
                  formless, and constantly evocative. Previously active under
                  the names <i>Kam Hassah</i> and <i>Endless Sea</i>, his recent
                  solo project Mercury Hall marks a new chapter in one of
                  Italy’s most stimulating musical journeys. <i>Lettera 22</i>,
                  <i>Primorje</i>, and <i>Casa Di Caccia</i> are among his group
                  experiences. He is also the founder of the labels
                  <i>Second Sleep</i>, active since 2007, and
                  <i>Musica Moderna</i>.

                  From the Beach Boys to Ariel Pink, from Daniel Johnston to the
                  Microphones/Mount Eerie, the so-called lo-fi—short for “low
                  fidelity”—has now become a major chapter in the history of
                  indie music. But what fascinates us about these grainy,
                  home-recorded sounds, which drown exquisite pop melodies in a
                  tangle of hiss and unintended reverberations? And how can
                  lo-fi help us understand our relationship with the instruments
                  of power through technology, so that we might hack them to
                  shape our most intimate fantasies? Part music essay, part
                  private diary, part refined experiment in applied philosophy,
                  <i>Bassa Fedeltà</i> drags us into the dreamlike realms of
                  “bedroom music” par excellence, making Brian Wilson converse
                  with Félix Guattari, Perfume Genius with Mark Fisher, black
                  metal with Paolo Virno, transforming lo-fi musicians into
                  cyberpunk explorers of DIY recording and revealing how these
                  sounds—upending the hi-tech dogma—tell us about ourselves, our
                  lives under capitalism, and the strange ways we grapple with
                  pain, madness, and beauty.

                  <strong>SISTERS WITH TRANSISTORS</strong> is the untold story
                  of electronic music’s female pioneers, remarkable composers
                  who embraced machines and their liberating technologies to
                  utterly transform how we produce and listen to music today.

                  The remarkable world of electronic music has been constantly
                  evolving since its inception in the early 20th century. From
                  the unlimited possibilities of digital synthesisers, to the
                  recent analog recording revival; from the impossibly perfect
                  pitch of Auto-Tune, to the democratisation of music making for
                  a generation of 'bedroom’ producers, each of these
                  extraordinary developments is directly connected to the work
                  and artistry of the women featured in “Sisters with
                  Transistors”.

                  An opportunity to enjoy a shared reading experience in the
                  world of sounds, designed for children aged 3–6 and their
                  parents, with the aim of providing interesting ideas that can
                  be explored at home. This activity seeks to offer tools to

                  experiences within the family as a means of fostering better

                  dreamscape, made of celestial voices, sleepwalking gabber,

                  <strong>Heith</strong>’s music traverses multiple sonic
                  landscapes, settling in a no-man’s-land of electronic music
                  where organic and digital elements constantly intersect. Often
                  evoking confusion and disorientation, his music lays the
                  groundwork for a mediated conflict between different
                  practices, evident in his debut album X, wheel (2022, PAN),
                  where synthesizers, percussion, guitars, and electronics
                  occupy and compete for the same space. If X, wheel marked the
                  beginning of a tortuous exploration of consciousness, the
                  following EP, The Liars Tell… (2024, PAN), feels more like a
                  truce—a moment of meditation and pause from the strain of
                  dimensional leaps. At the center of this work is a hypnotic
                  exploration of synthesizers and voice, treated as a fragile,
                  spectral presence and rendered material through intense
                  digital transformations. After founding the label Haunter
                  Records in 2013, Heith became part of the curatorial team at
                  the legendary Milanese venue Macao. He has released a series
                  of EPs (Laguna 2018, Mud 2019, Lo Zoo di Venere 2020) and
                  collaborated with numerous artists, including Puce Mary,
                  Visio, Kareem Lotfy, and Jesse Osborne-Lanthier.

                  <strong>VIBRISSE</strong> is a two-headed project based in
                  Turin that works through frenetic and unpredictable selections
                  to break down any kind of separation between musical genres,
                  people, and emotions. The focus is on high-BPM hardcore, while
                  simultaneously incorporating influences from the contemporary
                  digital club scene. On the dance floor, the duo creates
                  euphoric experiences where tracks from across the entire
                  hardcore spectrum (uptempo, mainstyle, frenchcore, j-core,
                  gabber, makina) collide with unexpected hits drawn from other
                  equally energetic styles (slowstyle, EDM, 160 club, donk).
                  Their tracks have been released on labels such as Safe Cloud
                  Records (FR), Country Music (SE), Burenhinder (BE), Club Late
                  Music (FR), and Nightcore4TotalSluts (UK), while their
                  uncompromising mixes have appeared on Toxic Sickness (UK),
                  Childsplay (UK), Wixapolonia (PL), Gabber Industries Berlin
                  (DE), Ashida Park (AU), Soul Feeder (ITA/DE), Unizone (CZ),

                  <strong>Polymorphism</strong> is a multimedia and interactive
                  live performance project that explores hybrid connections
                  between body and technology in relation to the space that
                  hosts them, using pressure sensors and motion-tracking

                  <i>Deep Listening</i> is a practice created by Pauline
                  Oliveros, an American queer composer, improviser, and
                  performer, which explores the difference between the
                  involuntary nature of hearing and the voluntary, selective
                  nature of listening. In her book
                  <i>Deep Listening: A Composer's Sound Practice</i>, she
                  defines deep listening as learning to expand one’s perception
                  of sounds to include the entire space-time continuum of sound,
                  embracing as much of its vastness and complexity as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Practically, deep listening involves exercises in bodily
                  proprioception and guided listening to everyday sounds. In
                  this workshop, listening is explored as a poetic tool to
                  expand the boundaries of reality. Starting from Pauline
                  Oliveros’ deep listening practice, participants are guided to
                  rediscover the imaginative potential of listening, allowing
                  inner sounds to reveal new, unexplored landscapes.

                  The workshop led by <strong>Glauco Salvo</strong> alternates
                  indoor and outdoor sessions, focusing on listening and the
                  acoustic exploration of space, with particular attention to
                  the interaction between environmental and recorded sound,

                  <strong>Glauco Salvo</strong> is a musician and sound artist
                  active in the Italian independent and experimental scene. His
                  research focuses on exploring new pathways between folk, rock,
                  and experimental music through the use of string instruments
                  and sound recording/playback devices. He investigates
                  perceptual alteration and the contamination of environmental
                  recordings by artificial sounds and external agents,
                  transforming recordings into subtly unreal spaces by altering
                  their balance, color, and tone.

                  Italian music producer Gustavo Cambareri, better known as
                  <strong>Lefka</strong>, creates melancholic, abstract, and
                  abrasive compositions. Born in Italy and now based in
                  Amsterdam, he has released numerous albums spanning a wide
                  range of styles, from collaborations with the Milanese hip-hop
                  scene to noise performances, including his debut album
                  <i>Hypermelancholy</i> on <i>Hide Productions</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lefka’s exploratory musical practice is complemented by the
                  work of graphic designer and multidisciplinary artist
                  <strong>Fac</strong>, whose creations oscillate between the
                  real and the fictional, the natural and the artificial, the
                  recognizable and the unsettling. For Neanche Per Sogno, the

                  active in the field of electronic and experimental music.
                  Their work investigates the possibilities of algorithmic
                  composition in dialogue with acoustic space and as a listening
                  practice, both within sound research and in multidisciplinary
                  contexts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A central focus of their practice is the electronic medium as
                  a tool for observation and exploration: on one hand, through
                  algorithmic programming for sound synthesis and the processing
                  of complex data structures; on the other, through the study of
                  recorded sound and field recordings.

                Founded in Trento at the end of 2021,
                <strong>Trigger Collective</strong> is driven by a passion for
                sonic experimentation through unconventional means and
                approaches. Its aim is to create opportunities to share and
                intertwine different expressive forces, going beyond the
                individual dimension of its members.
              </p>
              <p>
                In its first year, the collective actively involved 15 artists
                and continuously draws inspiration from experimentation with
                live coding, analog synthesizers, feedback techniques, and
                hacked toys.

                <strong>Return_Nihil</strong>is the project in which Ardan Dal

                No-input mixers serve as the sole sound source, while the
                feedback they generate is manipulated but never fully tamed due
                to its unpredictable nature. Buzzkeeper reveres the spontaneous
                life of feedback and inhabits the tension between chaos and
                direction.

              similarity parameters deemed most relevant among the selected
              sound materials.
